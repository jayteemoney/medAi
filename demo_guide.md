# MedBlocAI 2-Minute Demo Guide

This guide will walk you through a 2-minute presentation of MedBlocAI for judges.

## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Good morning/afternoon, judges. My name is [Your Name] and I'm excited to present MedBlocAI, a decentralized application that empowers users to securely manage and analyze their health records using blockchain and AI."

"In many parts of Africa, access to consistent and secure health records is a major challenge. Patients' records are often fragmented, lost, or inaccessible when needed most. MedBlocAI solves this by giving patients full ownership and control over their medical data."

## Demo (1 minute)

### 1. Connect Wallet (15 seconds)

"Let's start by connecting our crypto wallet. MedBlocAI uses [mention the chain, e.g., Base Sepolia testnet] to create a secure and unique identity for each user. This is the first step to taking control of your health data."

**(Action):** Click the "Connect Wallet" button and approve the connection in your wallet extension.

### 2. Dashboard Overview (15 seconds)

"Once connected, you're taken to your personal dashboard. Here, you can see a summary of your health records, recent activity, and AI-powered insights."

**(Action):** Briefly point to the different sections of the dashboard.

### 3. Add a New Health Record (20 seconds)

"Adding a new record is simple and secure. Let's add a new prescription."

**(Action):**
1.  Navigate to the "Add Record" page.
2.  Fill in the form with a sample record (e.g., "Prescription for Amoxicillin", select "Prescription" as the record type, and add a sample file).
3.  Click "Add Record".

"All data is encrypted and stored on IPFS, a decentralized storage network. The transaction is then recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and verifiable record."

### 4. View Records (10 seconds)
